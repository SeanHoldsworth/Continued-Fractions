# Continued Fractions

Representations of constants and functions as simple or generalized continued
fractions allow for expansion to and arbitrary number of digits of accuracy.

This project initially provides a Python program capable of providing as many
digits of pi as requested. It does this using a generator function that will
provide an infinite number of digitsi, one digit per call, and calling it the
requested number of times.
