# Continued Fractions

Representations of constants and functions as simple or
[generalized continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_continued_fraction)
allow for expansion to an arbitrary number of digits of accuracy.

This project initially provides a Python program capable of providing as many
digits of pi as requested. It does this using a generator function that will
provide an infinite number of digits, one digit per call, and calling it the
requested number of times.

I've now added a JavaScript version of the same program that can be run from
the command line with Node.js.
